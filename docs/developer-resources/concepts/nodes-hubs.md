# Nodes and Hubs

## Avatar Node

An Avatar node is a decentralized app running on a computer that conforms to the EverLife gossip protocol and participates in the EverLife network. The Avatar node manages the feeds of avatars the node may control and communicates with other Avatars using a secure gossip protocol. The avatar nodes also can also orchestrate micro services and execute tasks using the skills that each avatar controlled by the node has.

## Hub Node

A Hub node run at public IPs and follow Avatars. They are mainly present to improve uptime/availability on the network and to archive information. The EverLife team runs some Hubs, but anybody can create and introduce their own.

## Discovery

Avatars discover each other over the LAN with multicast UDP and sync automatically. The avatar feeds are also replicated across the internet through Hub Nodes and other Avatar Nodes that this Avatar follows. We use Secure Scuttlebutt for replication, discovery and p2p gossip protocol based communication.
