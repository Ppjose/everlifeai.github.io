## Checking the logs

All log files are written to the `logs/` directory, relative to your `ELIFE_HOME` environment variable. Each of the core avatar services have their own log file. To view the logs in real time check out this tip about using [PM2 to monitor logs](dev-tricks.md#using-pm2-to-monitor-the-logs).

## Reporting an issue to the team

When reporting an issue, be sure to include the following information:

1. Your OS (Windows, Linux or MacOS), and version.
2. What version of the avatar software you are running.
3. The issue you are experiencing.
4. Any relevant information from the logs. It can be a little tricky to know what is relevant or not, typically errors or warnings are a good bet. Please [get in touch](../../contact.md) if you are not sure on what to include.
