# Running the Everlife.AI Avatar Node on your Raspberry Pi

Attention: Are you running the avatar node on a Raspberry Pi? [Tell us about your project](../../contact.md)!

The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a small and affordable computer which is very well suited to build IoT projects on. We are very exited to have the avatar node on the Raspberry Pi.
