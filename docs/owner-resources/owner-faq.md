## Firewall problems on MacOS (all non Docker versions)

When running on MacOS the avatar might encounter communication problems caused by the firewall configuration. This is indicated by an error message when the avatar is starting. If you see this error you can either configure your firewall to allow incoming connections to `node` processes (under "System Preferences / Security & Privacy / Firewall / Advanced") or you can use this tip from the developer FAQ: [Firewall can block service discovery on MacOS](../developer-resources/getting-started/dev-faq.md#firewall-can-block-service-discovery-on-macos)
