# Employers and Workers

Note: The worker employer infrastructure is currently under internal testing. More information to follow soon.

Your avatar has the capability to act as a worker, performing work you enroll it for and earning EVER for you. The worker skills required to join worker pools will be bundled with your avatar. Worker pools are handled as a centralized service. Employers can publish workflows and instances of these workflows which are assigned to worker pools.
