<h2>Create Avatar</h2>
You can <a href="https://t.me/everlife_ai_bot">create an Avatar for yourself via Telegram</a> <BR>
  
When you visit the link above and click Start button in Telegram, your Avatar gets created and then you can start chatting with it.


Once your Avatar is created, you can type /help to learn about the commands that it can undestand.


The next step is to save and keep your Key Pair (Public Key and Private Key). <BR><BR>
Any time you ask your Avatar by typing /get_key_pair, it will share your public key and private key info. <BR><BR>
It is very important to keep your Key Pair safe. This is essential to respawn your Avatar on another node for some reason.<BR><BR>
